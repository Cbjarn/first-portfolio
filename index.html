        <h1>Chance Bjarnson</h1>
        <h2>Lucky Son of a Bear</h2>

        <p>Hi, I’m Chance Bjarnson. You may know me as Darth Rufio in one variation or another.
          I’m a middle aged white male who enjoys pushing against the status quo while still being respectful
          of
          others.
          I am married with no kids currently, but do have three “fur” children.
          A rabbit, cat and dog. My ideal day consists of Reading, playing video games, spending time with my
          wife
          and
          eating some yummy food typically.</p>
        <p>When I grow up, I would like to have a stable career in the tech industry. Whether that involves
          cyber
          security,
          software development or something else, remains to be seen. Regardless, I am in the thick of it and
          trying
          to
          figure it out. In the long run I think it isn’t necessarily what will pay me the most but what will
          allow me
          and
          my family to live comfortably and allow me the ability to show up to work consistently with a smile
          on
          my
          face.</p>

          <h3>Technical Support Engineer, Tier 3</h3>

        <section>
          <h3>Technical Support Engineer, Tier 2</h3>
          <p>Workfront Adobe</p>
          <p>December 2019 - January 2022</p>
          <p>I work hand in hand with our Tier 1 agents and Development teams to troubleshoot and identify software
            issues.
            I also set up regular training sessions and internal certifications on on current but evolving products as
            well as new products,
            as well as regularly mentoring new employees.</p>

        <!-- Job 3 -->
        <section>
          <h3>Technical Support Engineer</h3>
          <p>Workfront Adobe</p>
          <p>August 2018 - December 2019</p>
          <p>I took incoming calls, chats, and cases from customers in regards to the software we provide. These were at
            times simple how to questions, but could often turn into small ad hoc training sessions. In rare cases these
            could help identify issues with the software which would then be communicated to the development team.</p>
